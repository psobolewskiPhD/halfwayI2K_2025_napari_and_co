The original basis for these workshop materials was the [`napari-workshops-template` project](https://github.com/napari/napari-workshop-template). 
Some notebooks were removed and reorganized. Additionally, the `napari application` walkthrough was based on [material from a workshop](https://github.com/dgmccart/intro-to-napari-workshop) prepared by Dannielle McCarthy ([@dgmccart](https://github.com/dgmccart)), Sean Martin ([@seankmartin](https://github.com/seankmartin)), and Melissa Weber Mendonça ([@melissawm](https://github.com/melissawm)).
For information on preparing your own workshop materials using the template, please see [the documentation for the `napari-workshops-template` repository](https://napari.org/napari-workshop-template/docs/build_your_workshop.html).
