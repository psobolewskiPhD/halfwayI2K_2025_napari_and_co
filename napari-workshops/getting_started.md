# Getting started

This workshop will focus on using `napari` from a Jupyter notebook to carry out exploratory image analysis. You will learn how to launch napari from Jupyter, how to interact with it, and how to document your work using `nbscreenshot`.

## Audience

The workshop is intended for people with some experience with (bio)image analysis. At least beginner experience with Python, the scientific Python ecosystem (numpy, scikit-image, etc.), and Jupyter notebooks is recommended.

## Goals
By the end of the workshop you should be able to:

- use napari as an image viewer, from a Jupyter notebook
- use napari to explore image analysis steps
- be able to `nbscreenshot` to capture intermediate steps and document your work

## Pre-workshop setup

Before the workshop, please ensure you have a running napari installation. We recommend an up-to-date `conda` installation and the proper environment for the workshop. Alternately, if you are not comfortable with Python and the command line, please install and use the napari bundled application. For both cases, see instructions [here](./installation.md).

## Workshop content

The executed and rendered notebooks are [included in this repository](notebooks/index.md). We strongly encourage you to follow along with your own, fresh notebook. However, if you would like to down load and execute the completed notebooks locally, please see [the instructions here](notebook_setup.md). Alternately, you can install the `napari-workshop-browser` plugin and paste the following:
`https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/intro-napari-workshop/archive/refs/heads/main.zip`

This will allow you to follow along with the notebooks used in the second session without needing to write code.
Finally, the completed notebooks can also be run in the cloud [using Binder](launching_binder.md).
